## Design Framework

### Architecture Design Principles

#### SOLID Architecture Compliance
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component has one clear purpose
- **Open/Closed**: Architecture supports extension without modification
- **Liskov Substitution**: Components are properly substitutable
- **Interface Segregation**: Clean, focused interfaces
- **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules independent of low-level details

#### Quality Standards Integration
- **Maintainability**: Clear structure and documentation
- **Scalability**: Design supports growth and load increases
- **Testability**: Architecture facilitates comprehensive testing
- **Security**: Built-in security considerations and patterns
- **Performance**: Efficient algorithms and resource usage

### Design Components

#### 1. Architecture Overview
**System Structure:**
- High-level component organization
- Architectural patterns and styles
- Technology stack integration
- Deployment architecture

**Design Patterns:**
- Architectural patterns (MVC, Microservices, Layered, etc.)
- Design patterns (Factory, Observer, Strategy, etc.)
- Integration patterns (API Gateway, Circuit Breaker, etc.)
- Data patterns (Repository, Unit of Work, etc.)

#### 2. Component Specifications
**Component Design:**
- Class definitions and responsibilities
- Method signatures and contracts
- Component relationships and dependencies
- Interface specifications

**Interaction Design:**
- Component communication protocols
- Data flow and message passing
- Event handling and notifications
- Error propagation and handling

#### 3. Data Architecture
**Data Models:**
- Entity definitions and attributes
- Relationship mappings and constraints
- Schema design and normalization
- Data access patterns

**Storage Design:**
- Database selection and configuration
- Indexing strategy and optimization
- Data migration and versioning
- Backup and recovery considerations

#### 4. Integration Architecture
**External System Integration:**
- API specifications and contracts
- Authentication and authorization
- Data synchronization strategies
- Error handling and resilience

**Internal Integration:**
- Module communication protocols
- Event-driven architecture
- Message queuing and processing
- Service discovery and routing

## Design Process

### Stage 1: Requirements Analysis
**Task Breakdown Review:**
1. Analyze approved task list comprehensively
2. Identify design requirements and constraints
3. Map functional requirements to architectural components
4. Establish non-functional requirements (performance, security, scalability)

**Context Integration:**
- Review existing system architecture
- Identify integration points and dependencies
- Assess technology stack compatibility
- Consider organizational constraints and preferences

### Stage 2: Architecture Design
**High-Level Design:**
1. Define overall system architecture and patterns
2. Identify major components and their responsibilities
3. Design component relationships and interfaces
4. Create architectural diagrams and documentation

**Technology Integration:**
- Select appropriate technologies and frameworks
- Design technology stack integration
- Plan deployment and infrastructure requirements
- Consider development and operational constraints

### Stage 3: Detailed Specification
**Component Design:**
1. Define detailed component specifications
2. Design class structures and method signatures
3. Specify interfaces and contracts
4. Plan component testing strategies

**Data Design:**
- Design data models and relationships
- Create database schema specifications
- Plan data access and manipulation patterns
- Design data validation and integrity rules

### Stage 4: Integration Planning
**System Integration:**
1. Design API specifications and protocols
2. Plan external system integration approaches
3. Design error handling and resilience patterns
4. Create integration testing strategies

**Quality Assurance:**
- Review design against quality standards
- Validate SOLID principles compliance
- Assess security and performance implications
- Plan quality assurance and testing approaches
