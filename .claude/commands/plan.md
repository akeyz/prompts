# Planning Workflow Command

Launch comprehensive "Idea to Implementation Plan" workflow for transforming concepts into detailed, actionable development plans.

## Command

`/plan`

## Purpose

Execute structured planning workflow that transforms vague ideas into comprehensive implementation plans through iterative refinement and collaborative development.

## Usage

```
/plan [stage] [focus]
```

**Stages:**
- `start` - Initialize new planning session
- `idea` - Stage 1: Idea to Requirements
- `tasks` - Stage 2: Requirements to Tasks
- `design` - Stage 3: Tasks to Design
- `tests` - Stage 4: Design to Test Cases
- `review` - Complete plan review and validation

**Focus Areas:**
- `feature` - Plan new feature development
- `project` - Complete project planning
- `epic` - Epic decomposition and planning
- `refactor` - Refactoring project planning
- `integration` - Integration project planning

## Planning Workflow Stages

### Stage 1: Idea → Requirements
**Objective**: Transform initial concept into clear, verifiable requirements

**Process:**
1. Capture user's initial idea in structured format
2. Ask targeted clarifying questions to resolve ambiguities
3. Draft specific functional and non-functional requirements
4. Define Given-When-Then acceptance criteria
5. Request user review and explicit confirmation

**Output Structure:**
```markdown
## Idea
[Initial concept and vision]

## Requirements
### Functional Requirements
- [Specific functionality descriptions]

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [Performance, security, usability requirements]

### Acceptance Criteria
- Given [condition], When [action], Then [outcome]
```

**Quality Standards:**
- Clear, unambiguous requirement statements
- Testable acceptance criteria
- Complete coverage of user needs
- Stakeholder value alignment

### Stage 2: Requirements → Tasks
**Objective**: Decompose requirements into actionable, prioritized task breakdown

**Process:**
1. Analyze approved requirements comprehensively
2. Apply MECE principles for task decomposition
3. Define clear objectives and deliverables for each task
4. Establish priorities based on value, dependencies, and risk
5. Request user review and confirmation

**MECE Task Breakdown Principles:**
- **Mutually Exclusive**: No overlap between tasks
- **Collectively Exhaustive**: Complete requirement coverage
- **Clear Objectives**: Precisely defined goals for each task
- **Verifiable Deliverables**: Specific, measurable outcomes
- **Manageable Size**: Reasonable completion timeframes
- **Prioritized Order**: Business value and dependency consideration
- **Independent Execution**: Parallel work capability

**Output Structure:**
```markdown
## Tasks
### High Priority
1. [Task with clear objective and deliverable]
2. [Task with dependencies noted]

### Medium Priority
[Continue task breakdown]

### Dependencies
- [Task A] depends on [Task B]
```

### Stage 3: Tasks → Design
**Objective**: Create comprehensive technical design specification

**Process:**
1. Analyze approved task breakdown
2. Design system architecture and component relationships
3. Create detailed technical specifications
4. Integrate with existing architecture and quality standards
5. Request user review and confirmation

**Design Components:**
- **Architecture Overview**: System structure and patterns
- **Component Design**: Classes, methods, and relationships
- **Data Design**: Models, schemas, and relationships
- **Interface Design**: APIs, contracts, and protocols
- **Integration Points**: External system interactions

**Output Structure:**
```markdown
## Design
### Architecture Overview
[High-level system design]

### Component Specifications
[Detailed component design]

### Data Models
[Schema and relationship design]

### Integration Architecture
[External system integration]

### Quality Considerations
[Security, performance, maintainability]
```

**Visual Documentation:**
- Mermaid diagrams for architecture visualization
- Component relationship diagrams
- Data flow illustrations
- Integration mapping

### Stage 4: Design → Test Cases
**Objective**: Define comprehensive testing strategy and scenarios

**Process:**
1. Analyze approved design specification
2. Define test cases for all functionality
3. Ensure complete requirement coverage
4. Plan testing strategy and implementation approach
5. Request user review and final confirmation

**Test Case Categories:**
- **Positive Scenarios**: Normal operation validation
- **Negative Scenarios**: Error condition handling
- **Edge Cases**: Boundary condition testing
- **Integration Tests**: Component interaction validation
- **Performance Tests**: Non-functional requirement validation

**Output Structure:**
```markdown
## Test Cases
### Unit Test Scenarios
[Component-level testing]

### Integration Test Scenarios
[System interaction testing]

### End-to-End Test Scenarios
[Complete workflow validation]

### Performance Test Scenarios
[Non-functional requirement validation]

## Next Steps
[Implementation roadmap and priorities]
```

## Document Management

### Single Markdown File Approach
- **Consistency**: Standardized H2 section structure
- **Iterative**: Update one section at a time
- **Collaborative**: User confirmation at each stage
- **Traceable**: Complete planning history preservation

### Document Structure Template
```markdown
# [Project/Feature] Implementation Plan

## Idea
[Initial concept]

## Requirements
[Functional and non-functional requirements]

## Tasks
[MECE task breakdown]

## Design
