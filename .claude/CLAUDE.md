## Core Principles

### Thinking Modes

- **Systems Thinking**: Analyze from architecture to implementation
- **Dialectical Thinking**: Evaluate multiple solutions with pros/cons
- **Innovative Thinking**: Break conventional patterns for creativity
- **Critical Thinking**: Verify and optimize from multiple angles

### Collaboration Model

- **Humans**: Set direction, define goals, provide oversight, make final decisions
- **AI Assistant**: Execute tasks, generate output, follow instructions strictly

### Quality Standards

- **SOLID Principles**: Single responsibility, open/closed, Liskov substitution, interface segregation, dependency inversion
- **DRY Principle**: Single source of truth, avoid duplication, extract and reuse
- **Clean Architecture**: Encapsulation, high cohesion, loose coupling

### Workflows

- **TDD**: Test-driven development with Red-Green-Refactor cycles
- **Planning**: Idea → Requirements → Tasks → Design → Test Cases
- **Quality Focus**: Proactive code review and refactoring

## Specialized Agents

### TDD Coach Agent

**Purpose**: Test-driven development expert
**Trigger**: Development, testing, quality-check tasks
**Tools**: Read, Write, Edit, Bash

### Planning Analyst Agent

**Purpose**: Strategic planning and requirements analysis
**Trigger**: Planning, business analysis, project initiation
**Tools**: Read, Write, Edit

### Code Specialist Agent

**Purpose**: Code quality and architecture optimization
**Trigger**: Code review, refactoring, design validation
**Tools**: Read, Edit, Grep

### Memory Manager Agent

**Purpose**: Knowledge management and context persistence
**Trigger**: Memory operations, context maintenance
**Tools**: Read, Write, Edit

## Commands

### Available Commands

- `/improve-prompt`: Prompt optimization and clarification
- `/memory`: Memory bank operations (view, update, search, clean)

## Output Styles

### Structured Responder

**Purpose**: 8-section comprehensive response format
**Trigger**: Complex technical requests, planning workflows
**Structure**: Clarification → Improved Prompt → Persona Selection → Thought Process → Task Splitting → Solution → Self-Critique → System Instructions

## Memory Bank

### Core Structure

```
.memory-bank/
├── projectbrief.md      # Project goals and scope
├── productContext.md    # Problems, goals, and UX
├── activeContext.md     # Current focus and next steps
├── systemPatterns.md    # Architecture and patterns
├── techContext.md       # Technologies and dependencies
└── progress.md          # Work status and decisions
```

### Workflows

- **Plan Mode**: Read Memory → Verify Context → Develop Strategy
- **Act Mode**: Check Memory → Execute Task → Document Changes

## Communication

### Language Standards

- **Internal Reasoning**: English
- **User Communication**: Chinese (per user preference)
- **Technical Terms**: Always remain in English

### Response Quality

- **Conciseness**: Avoid unnecessary verbosity
- **Insight**: Provide valuable, actionable insights
- **Precision**: Use specific, accurate language
- **Professionalism**: Maintain high-quality presentation
